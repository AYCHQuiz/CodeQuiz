//Psuedo code:
// needs a call to action to "start quiz" (alert and button)

function quizTime () {
    var questionArray = [];

}

var startQuiz = document.getElementById ("Start");
startQuiz.addEventListener("click", function()) {
  var questionsStart = 
}
  quiztime(questions);

//if statement?




//need to build a high score page and a timer that starts at 75 seconds (increments, count++)

//needs a onclick event to start the quiz (make a button also) and then the questions will appear
//timer needs to start as soon as the question appears.  Make sure the timer is given a max amount of time for the user to click an answer and count downwards

//start calculating the score incrementally when the user gets a right answer ; create an alert on the page that tells you if the answer is right or wrong
//answering incorrectly results in a time penalty of 5 seconds from the total of seconds

//make it responsive in html

//when timer is done and/or all questions have been answered, show final score and create an input for the user to enter intials
// then show final score and initials in "local storage"

// store questions as an array of objects in a separate js file
// so you will need to reference questions.js
//length of array will determine the length of play: 15 seconds per question so if i have 5 questions then the time will be 75
